## ⚙️ Functionalities 

1) Category Loading 
Load Tree Categories dynamically on the left side.

2) Category Click → Tree Data 
On clicking a category: load trees of that category.

Display in a 3-column card layout.

3) Card Contents 
 Each card includes:

        - Image

        -  Name

        - Short description

        - Category

        - Price

        - Add to Cart button

4) Modal on Card Click 
Clicking a tree name on a card opens a modal with full tree details.


##  🧪 Challenges 


    1) Add to Cart

                          - Shows tree name 

    2) Total Calculation 
    Calculate total price of trees in cart.

    3) Remove from Cart

    5) Active Button State

=======
1) What is the difference between var, let, and const?
  ans:var: function-scooped, initialized as undefined, allowed in same scope,re-assignment allowed.

let: block-scoped, not initialized, not allowed in same scope, re-assignment allowed.

const: block-scoped, not initialized, not allowed in same scope, re-assignment not allowed.

2) What is the difference between map(), forEach(), and filter()?
  ans:map(): returns value with a new array with transformed elements.

 forEach(): Just loop.

 filter(): returns value with a new array with elements that pass a test.

3) What are arrow functions in ES6?
  ans:Arrow functions are a shorter and cleaner way to write functions in js.

4) How does destructuring assignment work in ES6?
  ans:It lets us unpack values from arrays or objects in a clean way.

5) Explain template literals in ES6. How are they different from string concatenation?
  ans:Template literals are a new way to work with strings in JavaScript. They use backticks instead of quotes.

Template literals are especially great when dealing with dynamic content,that's where they are different from string concatenation.
